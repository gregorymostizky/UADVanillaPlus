# UAD Vanilla Plus

UAD Vanilla Plus (`UAD:VP`) is a lightweight mod for Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts that keeps the base game feel while adding small quality-of-life improvements.

Current version: `0.1.2`

## Installation

1. Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) for Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts.
2. Download the latest `UADVanillaPlus.dll` from the repository releases page.
3. Copy `UADVanillaPlus.dll` into your game `Mods` folder.

Typical Steam install path:

```text
...\Steam\steamapps\common\Ultimate Admiral Dreadnoughts\Mods
```

Start the game normally after copying the DLL. If the mod loads, `UAD:VP` and the version number will appear in the game's version text.

## Features

- Designs tab country viewer: browse major AI nations' ship designs from the campaign Designs tab.

## Building And Running From Source

Clone the repository and build the solution with .NET 6:

```powershell
dotnet build .\UADVanillaPlus.sln -c Release
```

If the project cannot find your game install automatically, set `UAD_PATH` to the Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts install folder:

```powershell
$env:UAD_PATH='E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Ultimate Admiral Dreadnoughts\'
dotnet build .\UADVanillaPlus.sln -c Release
```

The built DLL will be here:

```text
UADVanillaPlus\bin\Release\net6.0\UADVanillaPlus.dll
```

To build and copy directly into the game's `Mods` folder:

```powershell
dotnet build .\UADVanillaPlus.sln -c Release /p:DeployOnBuild=true
```

## Thanks

UAD Vanilla Plus is inspired by the work of the [Tweaks and Fixes / UAD Realism DIP team](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP), especially as a reference for how Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts modding works.
